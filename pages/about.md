# **What I Do?**

I specialize in architecting and building data pipelines that transform raw structured/unstructured data into 
formats usable for visualizations that enable clients to understand the underlying causes of complex business issues and gain
foresight into their occurrence.

I deliver end-to-end analytics solutions from conceptualization of complex business problems through
implementation as interactive dashboards, which enable clients to leverage data analytics to identify, monitor,
and investigate their businessâ€™ risks and optimize performance.

I have experience in overcoming barriers companies encounter relating to their management of people, processes
and technologies when deploying sustainable, scalable data analytics solutions.
